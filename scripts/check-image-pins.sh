# check-image-pins.sh — fail when any compose image is not pinned by digest.
#
# Supply-chain gate (Essential Eight patch/application control on Linux =
# image allowlisting + pinning): every `image:` in the compose files this
# stack loads must carry @sha256:… so a deploy pulls exactly the bytes that
# were reviewed. Renovate's pinDigests keeps pins current.
#
# What is checked:
#   * the root docker-compose.yml include list — the authoritative set of what
#     compose actually loads. Every entry must be one of
#     apps/<name>/docker-compose.yml, scaffold/docker/caddy.base.yml or
#     .generated/caddy/networks.yml; anything else fails, so a compose file
#     cannot be slipped in under a path the other checks never look at;
#   * every apps/*/docker-compose.yml, included or not;
#   * no `build:` (a locally built image has no digest to pin);
#   * deploy hooks: no docker run/pull/create of an unpinned image and no
#     download piped into a shell.
# Trailing comments on an image: line are stripped before the digest test, so
# a comment cannot hide an unpinned image.
